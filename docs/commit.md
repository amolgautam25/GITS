# How to run it? (Small Example)
Let say you are on a particular branch working on some feature X. 
You've made some changes so far and you want to commit those chnages.
You can use the following command to do so:
```
$ gits commit -m "My first commit"
```
Soon after you realized a mistake in the last commit and want to fix that mistake.
However you do not want others to notice that mistake. 
In this situation, you can use the amend argument as shown below to update the last commit.
```
$ gits commit -m "My first commit with mistake fixed" --amend
``` 
After successful execution of this command, you will still have only one commit for the changes you have made so far.
